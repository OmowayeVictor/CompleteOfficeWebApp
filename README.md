| Problem                             | Solution                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Can't connect to DB                 | Check connection string in `appsettings.json`.                           |
| Login fails after Docker deploy     | Ensure DB is accessible inside the container or use environment variables for DB config. |
| Permissions not applying correctly  | Verify claims are set correctly on the user and `IsAuthorized` logic is working. |
